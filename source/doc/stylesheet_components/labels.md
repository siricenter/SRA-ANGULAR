## Labels

### Colors

Labels include all the theme classes/color variations by using the `.label-COLOR` class (ex: `.label-success`).

the `COLOR` is a named color like `danger` or `primary` or `info-lt` (check out the `variables` file for all available variations)

### 45 degree tilt

The effect on the pricing table is made with these labels. Requires adding a `.sticky-parent-box` to the box that holds the label, and a `.sticky-left` on the label

The `.sticky-left` properties will need tweaking to look good, depending on the text inside (they are not really meant for dynamic content)
