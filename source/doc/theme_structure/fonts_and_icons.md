### Fonts and icons

Emerald uses Open Sans as a base font, and also includes font-awesome, icomoon and line-icons for icon fonts

You can easily add new fonts, or remove any of them by editing the `source/stylesheets/fonts/_fonts.scss` file, which imports all the defined fonts

If you add new fonts, add the font files in the `fonts` directory, and follow the way we defined the fonts each in it's own file, and import them in the `_fonts.scss` file
