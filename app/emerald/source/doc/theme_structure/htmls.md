## HTML structure

Most of the html/erb templates reside in the `htmls` folder. There is also a `layouts` folder which holds layout elements exclusively (like sidebar, navbar etc)

## The menu

The sidebar menu gets configured from the `conf/sidebar.yml` file, which you could reuse if you're doing a static website starting directly from this template
