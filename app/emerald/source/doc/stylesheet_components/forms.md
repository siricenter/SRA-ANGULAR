##Forms

Form controls don't require special markup, but we added new functionality:

* `.form-control-header` - works exactly like `form-control-feedback` only the icon is on the left side
* `.form-control.transparent` - for when you need transparent background on all states (used in the calendar note widget)
* `textarea.non-resizable` - removes the right tick on the bottom of a textarea that allows it to resize (used in the calendar note widget)
